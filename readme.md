# About
This project provides written in Java API for interaction with a Polkadot or Substrate based network.

## Key features
- ### Java 8 or higher.
The main idea is to make this library available and usable for as many projects as possible.

- ### Non-blocking API.

The API is designed to be non-blocking in order to not engage resources for waiting responses from a node, especially when working with web sockets.
Each method returns `CompletableFuture<>`.

- ### Declarative approach.
Some of our goals are:
- make API simpler for usage;
- let users organize their code similar to the one in the pallet they are interacting with;
- hide difficulties of low level and infrastructure code;
- facilitate the future maintenance.

The best approach to reach projectâ€™s goals is to use annotations and code generation techniques. Below are listed some annotations that this API shall provide:
- [x] Scale
    - [x] `@ScaleWriter`;
    - [x] `@ScaleReader`;
    - [x] `@Scale`;
    - [x] `@ScaleGeneric`;
    - [x] `@Ignore`;

- [x] Rpc
    - [x] `@RpcInterface`;
    - [x] `@RpcCall`;
    - [x] `@RpcSubscription`;
    - [x] `@RpcEncoder`;
    - [x] `@RpcDecoder`;

- [ ] Pallet
    - [x] `@Pallet`;
    - [ ] `@Transaction`;
    - [x] `@Storage`;
    - [x] `@Event`.

These allow the generation of scale serializers, deserializers, RPC methods, code for interaction with pallet, etc.
More examples you can find below.

- ### Deferred parametrization of codecs
Annotations for codecs allow deferring parameters of a generic until it's used at an RPC method. E.g.:
 ```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Getter
@ScaleWriter
public class Some<A> {
    private final int number;
    private final A some;
}

@RpcInterface(section = "test")
public interface TestSection {
  @RpcCall(method = "sendSome")
  CompletableFuture<Boolean> doNothing(@Scale Some<Parameter> value);
}
```
Annotation processors will generate scale writer for the class `Some` which expects another writer as a dependency.
When a processor faces a parameter like `Some<String> value`, it injects the `Strings`'s writer into the writer of `Some`.

- ### GC Manageable requests.
We take care of either lost responses or canceled futures by not holding handlers that are needed to match an RPC request with a response.

- ### Tests run with substrate node.
All API methods related to the substrate node will be tested for operability and compatibility.
Currently, we use [test containers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and docker image [parity/substrate:v3.0.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/parity/substrate/v3.0.0/images/sha256-1aef07509d757c584320773c476dcb6077578bbf2f5e468ceb413dcf908897f1?context=explore).
